# Data-Science-Portfolio
The purpose of this reposatory is to build and develope personal skills in many machine learning & AI methods, specifiying the benefits and cons for each one depedning on the data set and the overall goal

The following methods will be used:

  Supervised:
  
    -Linear regression
    -Logistic regression
    -Decision trees
    -K-nearest neighbors
    -Naive Bayes
    -Enseble Mehods:
      -Bagging
      -Boosting
      -Random forest
    -Support-vector machines
    -Neural networks (Multilayer perceptron)*
    
  Unsupervised:
  
    -Clustering:
        -hierarchical clustering, 
        -k-means,
        -DBSCAN,
     -Anomaly detection:
        -Local Outlier Factor
        -Isolation Forest
     -Association Analysis
        -Apriori Rule
_* Deep learning method_
